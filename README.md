# Helmet-Detection-and-Email-Alert-System
This project is a **computer vision–based safety monitoring system** that detects whether a person is wearing a helmet using **YOLO v11**.  
If a safety violation is detected (no helmet), the system automatically sends an **email alert** to the concerned authority.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI can be used for **real-time safety compliance** in industrial and road environments.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Input images or video frames are passed to the **YOLO v11 model**
2. The model detects:
   - Helmet
   - No Helmet
3. If **No Helmet** is detected:
   - An **email alert** is triggered automatically
4. The alert notifies the safety authority for immediate action

## 📧 Email Alert System

- The system sends an automated email when a helmet violation is detected
- This makes the system **proactive**, not just informative
- Designed to reduce manual supervision and improve response time

> ⚠️ *In real-world deployment, email credentials should be stored securely using environment variables or secret managers.*
